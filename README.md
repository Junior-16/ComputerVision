This repository aims to keep my studies on computer vision developed in the [Computer Vision Study Group](https://github.com/uffscv). The main content found here is related to CV techniques like image segmentation, convolution, [High Dynamic Range](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range), [Optical Character Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition), [Seamless Cloning](https://www.learnopencv.com/seamless-cloning-using-opencv-python-cpp/)
